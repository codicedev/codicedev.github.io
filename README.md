# About Me Site

# Introduce Yourself to Us
You can talk about anything interesting about you as you wish. We always want to know more!
Possible topics are: Hobbies, Dream, funny experiences etc
Please make it detail and nice-looking. (You could use this as your personal site in the future!)
You are allowed and encouraged to use any technology included in this prep course. HTML, CSS and JS are definitely useful.

# Requirements
Your website should contain at least three sections:
The first what you did before the bootcamp 
The second why you joined the bootcamp and what you hope to achieve 
The final section is the photo album concerning your life and hobbies.

# A Photo Album Showing Who You Are
Please include some photos that are about you or you found interesting to be shared.
The photo album should be written from scratch by yourself.

# A Readme for your about-me page written in Markdown
Markdown's syntax is very similar to wiki syntax.
You should include what is inside your about-me site.
Please make it detailed and nice-looking. (You could use this as your personal site in the future!)
You are also expected to explain your implementation (Why do did things in certain ways) any issues you had when trying to develop the website.

# Sample folder structure of the About Me site
    
## Bonus
Bootstrap and jQuery are packages that we use later in the course if you have time and want to try to use and implement these tools for advanced effects please try!
Make your photo album more interesting by using mouse events.
